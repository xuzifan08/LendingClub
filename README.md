# LendingClub

## Introduction

LendingClub.com was founded in 2005. Annual returns on peer-to-peer lending are higher and more attractive compare to the saving rates and bond yields, but riskier. The number of issued loans increased dramatically over the years in Lending Club from 21K in 2011 to 47 billion in 2019. Therefore, there has been increasing demands for intelligently automated programs to pick up the “Right Loan” to get risk-free or low-risk returns of the loan investments as typical fixed income investors expect. 

In this project, based on the lending club data which has more than 226k rows and 145 columns, my objective is to extract useful information for exploratory data analysis through data cleaning, and build a prototype of production data pipeline which allows data scientists and data analysts to interactively query and explore the data, and will also be used for machine learning model training and evaluation.

The baby data pipeline should reach several standards:
- Create a relational data model / schema in a database or storage engine
- Develop code that will persist the dataset into this storage system in a fully automated way
- Include any data validation routines if necessary

## Motivation
 1. Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
 2. Build a prototype of production data pipeline to support software engineeris, data scientists and data analysts.

## Data source
Lending club data is stored in Kaggle as a csv file: https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data
